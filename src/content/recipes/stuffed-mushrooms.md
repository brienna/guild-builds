title: "“We’ve got beef with management” Stuffed Mushrooms"
ingredients: [
  2-3 cartons of white button mushrooms,
  '1 pack of raw & seasoned sausage (e.g. bob evans spicy or sweet italian). Can be pork or beef patties or sausage links. I prefer the patties because then you don’t have to squeeze the meat out from the sausage casing',
  1 block of cream cheese,

Preheat oven to 400 F.

Wash and de-stem the mushrooms so it’s just the mushroom cap. (keep the stems and use them as mushrooms for other cooking endeavors!)

Pat dry the mushrooms.

In a pan over medium high heat, break up/crumble the sausage and saute until it’s cooked.

Turn off the heat and add the block of cream cheese. Mix together.

Stuff the mushrooms with the cream cheese/ground sausage mixture.

Bake on a baking sheet (NOT glass pan because the mushrooms will release a lot of liquid and the glass doesn’t allow it to evaporate) for 30-40 minutes or until the tops are golden and the mushrooms look cooked. You will also smell them!
