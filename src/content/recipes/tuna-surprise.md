Preheat oven to 400.

Cook pasta until just tender.

Mix breadcrumbs/panko and Parmesan cheese with 4 tbsp olive oil (or oil from tuna can).

Transfer pasta to large bowl and mix in remaining ingredients.

Transfer to mixture to casserole dish, and sprinkle with breadcrumb mixture.

Bake for 25 minutes or until topping is golden brown.

### Tip:

Try switching out the peas/scallions for any combos of veggies you enjoy! I’ve tried chopped onions, canned or fresh green beans, artichoke hearts, etc.
